Calorie Prediction App

A machine learning web application that predicts the calorie content of food based on nutritional values.
Built using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit, and deployed on Streamlit Cloud.

Project Overview

This project uses the USDA Food Nutrition Dataset to train a machine learning model that predicts calories from nutritional inputs 
such as protein, fat, carbohydrates, sugar, sodium, and cholesterol.

The trained model is integrated into an interactive Streamlit web app, allowing users to enter nutritional values and instantly receive a calorie prediction.
